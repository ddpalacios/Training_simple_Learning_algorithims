# Training_simple_Learning_algorithims
Chapter 2 Machine Learning

This Chapter will cover topics around the Perceptron, AdalineGD & AdalineSGD


Each model will hold their own interpretation. 

testing_data.py focuses on where all of our data will be placed and playing around with.  

Each import calls the these basic models for problems that involve Logistic Regression

Clone This repo and use Matplotlib.pyplot to plot your results. 

Each model contains a .predict() method which is useful for our plot_regions method (Which is based of Python Machine Learning Textbook)

plt regions will allow you to see the diffrentiation of the different models that are used to solve the problem.
