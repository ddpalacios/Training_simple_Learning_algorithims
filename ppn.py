#This script will demonstrate our simpliest classification model --> Perceptron
#Lets start by import the following libraries and create a dummy dataset

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = np.array([
       [1.2 ,1.1 ,1.0],
       [2.2, 5,  1.0],
       [1.0,   2,  1.0],
       [1.7 ,1.5, 1.0],
       [2.3, 4.1, 1.0],
       [4.0, 5.0, 0.0],
       [3,  9.0, 0.0],
       [4.5, 6.2, 0.0],
       [5.5 ,2.1 ,0.0],
       [7.7 ,5.4, 0.0 ]])
#Now that we have our Dataset, lets create our simple model
